      - "These will help you find the matching Physical Frame Number (PFN) tag, if you are 'Lucky'."
      - "Right now all you have is a Virtual Address (VA) in Hexadecimal, but the tags are in binary. What can you do to 'calculate' it?"

    after_calculator:
      - "Great! You have successfully converted your Virtual Address (VA) from hexadecimal to binary."
      - "Now try to find the matching Virtual Page Number (VPN) tag presented over the chests."
      - "Remember: the first 4 bits are the VPN and the last 4 bits are the offset."
      - "If you found it, that is a TLB 'hit'."
      - "If you couldn't find it, that is a TLB 'miss'."

    after_hit_miss:
      - "You have selected {result}—so you believe that the TLB {did_not} cache the PFN mapping to a VPN?"

    after_hit_quiz_lucky:
      - "Excellent! You found the TLB entry. The Physical Frame Number is {pfn}."
      - "Now travel to RAM and locate this frame to confirm it's mapped to your process."

    after_hit_quiz_non_lucky:
      - "No, you don't see your VPN on any of the chests around you."
      - "This means it's a TLB Miss."
      - "Try again. Press the MISS button."

    after_miss_quiz_non_lucky:
      - "Excellent! This is a case of a TLB miss—the mapping was not cached."
      - "Now you can enter the Multi-Level Page Table, but for the door to open, you must answer this question:"

    after_miss_quiz_lucky:
      - "No, in this Lucky case, the VPN IS displayed on one of the chests in this room."

      - "  OFFSET: Offset within the page (last 4 bits)"
      - "Use the conversion guide on the signs and calculate."

      - "Remember: The TLB is the CPU's fast cache. It doesn't always have the answer."
      - "When the TLB missed, we must find the answer the hard way—the Page Table."
      - "The Page Table is like a massive filing system. It knows the mapping of every virtual page to its physical frame."
      - "But this library is organised in LEVELS to save space."
      - "Instead of one giant table with millions of entries, we have a hierarchy:"
      - "  - One Page Directory at the Ground Floor"
      - "  - Three Page Table levels above it"
      - "This way, unused memory regions don't waste space."

    before_entering:
      - "You are about to walk through the multi-level page table."
      - "But wait—how will we know which page table is ours?"
      - "The Page Table Base Register (PTBR) points to this process's page directory."
      - "The PTBR contains the address of where YOUR page table starts."
      - "It's like a bookmark that says: 'This process's memory mappings begin here.'"
      - "Every process has its own PTBR, so every process has its own page table."

      - "Use the first 2 bits (DIR) from your VPN to know which floor to go to."
      - "Look at the signs next to the stairs. They show: '01', '10', '11'"

      - "Each one of these chests represents a Page Table Entry (PTE)."
      - "Look at the signs above each chest. They show: '00', '01', '10', '11'"
      - "Match your TABLE bits (the last 2 bits of your VPN) to find your PTE."
      - "Once you find them, open the chest and retrieve the book inside—that is your PTE. The data will transfer to your map."

    wrong_floor:
      - "You are not on the correct floor. This is Page Table Floor {floor}."

    map_updated:

      - "Welcome to the Permission Chamber—the judgment hall of virtual memory."
      - "The Page Table Walk is complete. Now we must decide: what does the PTE tell us?"
      - "Before you stand four buttons, each representing a different outcome."
      - "Your task is to examine the PTE and choose wisely."
      - "If you want, you can ask me to explain the meaning of each option."

    after_button_press:

      - "The page you are trying to access is swapped out to disk."
      - "You must retrieve it from a special area called 'Swap Space'."
      - "Press the button to go to the Disk Room. I will meet you there."

      - "Now, we must act."
      - "Before you stand two buttons. Which will you choose?"

    after_button_press:

      - "The TLB is updated: VPN {vpn} → PFN {pfn}"

      - "Try again."

    second_visit:
      - "The process wants to write on this page."
      - "Check your map—you will see the instruction has changed to 'write' instead of 'read'."
      - "This triggers a different scenario."
      - "But wait—why is this NOT a normal write situation?"
      - "The page is MARKED AS READ-ONLY because multiple processes might share the zero-filled template."
      - "Even though this is YOUR allocated frame, the kernel marked it read-only as an optimisation."
      - "When you try to write, the read-only flag prevents it."
      - "Before the write can proceed, we must determine what happens."
      - "The kernel has three choices. Which is correct?"

      - "And your map is updated."
      - "Now go to RAM to see your private copy. You can now write to this page freely."
      - "Press the button to teleport to RAM."

    terminate_incorrect:

# ─── Concept explanations (player asks 'explain a concept') ────────────────
explanations:
  tlb:
    hit: "VPN found in cache. Fastest scenario—one CPU cycle."
    miss: "VPN not found in cache. Must walk page table. Slower but recoverable."
    location: "TLB lives in the CPU/MMU (not RAM). Special hardware with limited space (64-1024 entries)."
    importance: "Speeds up memory access. Most accesses hit cache (95-99%). Alternative to slow page table walks."

  address:
    vpn: "Virtual Page Number—the first 4 bits. Which page you're accessing. Used to find matching PFN."
    offset: "Last 4 bits. Position within the page. Stays unchanged when translating VA to PA."
    hex_to_bin: "TLB works in binary. VAs come in hex (human-readable). Must convert for TLB matching."

  page_table:
    why_multi_level: "Space efficiency—only allocate for used regions. Saves massive memory."
    ptbr: "CPU register pointing to page directory. A process-specific bookmark."
    isolation: "Each process has different virtual address spaces. Different mappings. Memory isolation and security."
    vpn_split: "DIR (first 2 bits) = which floor. TABLE (last 2 bits) = which chest."
    dir_range: "In this world, DIR uses entries 01-11. In the real world, 00 is also included!"
    pte: "Metadata about ONE page. PRESENT, READ, WRITE, PFN, etc. Contains all page information."

  permission_chamber:
    allow_access: "The kernel allows the memory access to proceed."
    page_fault: "The kernel cannot fulfill the memory access right now and must intervene. The page either doesn't exist in memory yet, or was evicted and needs to be brought back."
    segfault: "The memory access violates the boundaries of what this process is allowed to access."
    protection_fault: "The process is trying to access the page, but something about the access is not allowed—either permission bits deny it, or the page is marked with special protection."
    lazy_allocation: "The page is anonymous and needs to be created fresh."
    lazy_loading: "The page is file-backed and needs to be loaded from disk."
    swapped_out: "The page was evicted to disk and needs to be retrieved."

  memory:
    lazy_allocation_what: "Strategy where kernel doesn't allocate memory until needed. Page is anonymous and created fresh. Saves space because only used memory is allocated."
    lazy_allocation_why: "Massive waste if allocated upfront (4GB allocated, 10MB used). Limits concurrent processes. Lazy allocation is essential."
    zero_page_readonly: "Optimisation for sharing. Multiple processes share zero page. Only copy on write (COW)."
    lazy_loading_what: "Strategy where kernel defers loading file pages until needed. Only the accessed page is loaded from disk. Saves startup time and memory."
    page_index: "Think of a book with chapters. PAGE_INDEX = which chapter do you need? The kernel reads only the chapter you need, not the entire book."
    cow_what: "Copy-on-Write: multiple processes share a read-only page. When one writes, the kernel allocates a new frame, copies the data, maps the new frame, and marks it writable."
    swap_what: "Disk storage used as overflow for RAM. Kernel moves less-used pages from RAM to disk to free up space for active pages."
    swap_vs_file: "File storage is permanent and user-managed. Swap space is temporary and kernel-managed—organised by slot number."
    ram_what: "Random Access Memory. Fast primary memory. Nanosecond access. Limited capacity. Volatile. Divided into frames (each = one page size)."
    pfn_why: "Identification and retrieval: kernel uses PFN to find pages immediately. Mapping: PTE stores PFN for VPN→PFN translation. Management: tracking free/allocated frames."
    clock_algo: "Frames in a circle. Each has a USE BIT (red torch). ON when you pass it = turn it OFF (second chance). OFF when you pass it = that's the victim!"
